Battleship personal project. 
This project was built in Microsoft Visual Studio. 

The game plays in the console window, and uses a combination of a 
menu system and user keyboard entries to place ships and 
fire shots. 

There are some parts I'd like to work on more when I get around to it, as 
school work takes priority. I'd like to add a feature to edit the placement 
of a ship should the player want to reposition it. 
I also want to add more dialogue and possibly make the game more animated. 
However, the most important functionality is complete and the game is fully playable 
as the classic board game. The opponent is the computer. Although, a two player feature
would be nice to add.
